>>  SYNTAX
     SELECT col_name(s)

     where col_name operator
        (select col_name From table_name where)
>> Q4. Average Salary

    SELECT name 
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

 # 2.   In FROM clause (as table)

      FROM (SELECT dept, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal 
      FROM employees GROUP BY dept) AS temp;


ðŸ‘‰ Finds department with highest average salary.


# 3. In SELECT clause (scalar subquery)

SELECT name, (SELECT dept_name FROM departments d 
              WHERE d.dept_id = e.dept_id) AS department
               FROM employees e;
